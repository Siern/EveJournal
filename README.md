EVE Online API tools ** VERY OUT OF DATE **

Development of this tool ended in mid 2009.
Eve's API has likely changed a lot since then.  This means this tool likely does not function anymore due to API changes.  It stands as a coding sample for dealing with the API using SQLITE and C#.

This was a working tool used to manage an Industry Corp for a couple years in this game.
